    "* see how to access the SASIP data storage, \n",

    "* Beware that you will not be able to RECOVER your own notebooks or modifications today once you have closed your cloud session UNLESS you can synchronize them in a personnal repository in your github. There is a [tuto here](notebooks/4-Tuto-to-SAVE-via-GITHUB.ipynb) explaining the steps for synchronization (_this is not for github beginers, though_) or you can just download a notebook by clicking on `File/Download`.\n",
